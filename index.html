	<p> You'll be reading a lot of dramas and facts all 
		about me. This won't be the "Resume" type of site. 
		But the kind of Informal Site you have been 
		thinking right now. (I wish you won't be expecting
		too much.) <p>

	<h2 id="Drama">"Dramatic" and "Deep" Information</h2>
	
	<p>
		I am born as "Chinphiline" in this world. The "Kasumika Kimella" 
		is just a name given by the teller when they've got me registered to the Chinese government.
		But most of the people who have been a part of my life from very start
		calls me "Mika", "Mikaella", "Kim", or "Kasumi". But the new once calls me 
		"Chin". </p>

		<p><i> Question: 
		Why Kasumika Kimella when you can Register yourself to the Chinese Govenrment as Chinphiline? </p>

		<p> Answer: 
		3-4 months after my mother gave birth, we immediately travelled to China with a help of a Family Friend
		for a vacation and to register me in the Chinese NSO office. When evcerything is in the process, the women
		who is in-charge forgot the fact that I'm also registered in the Philippines. That's why when he asked my Father
		what do he wants to name me in English (Dual Citizenship application that's why it requires an English name) 
		and he only absentmindedly answered "Anything that suits her", Tada~~! She gave me that name! That caused a lot
		of trouble to my life up until now.
	 </p>	</i>

		<p> 
		I'm basically born physically weak. After 4 months of stay sa China, Bahay - School - Hospital - Bahay is my usual routine when I was young. 
		I've even tried Homeschooling which cost a lot kaya nag kanda kuba-kuba pamilya ko. </p>

		<p> <i> Is there a story behind this? </i> Yes. Takas sa bansang Tsina ang Daddy ko because he is treated as the
		blacksheep of the Family. Kaya walang wala siya nung dumating siya dito sa Pilipinas. But he manage to have
		a small business for years up until marriage nila ni Mommy. Mommy's family is basically poor. And si Mommy 
		pa bumubuhay sa 6 niyang kapatid plus her parents. She finished "Diploma in Agricultural Technology" at
		the University of Southeastern Eastern Philippines- Tagum Campus while working at NCCC up until nakapagtapos
		siya. </p>

		<p> 
			It all changed when I'm still a Grade 1 student in Davao Central High School (Davao Chong Hua High School right now).
			Daddy's family manage to find him and offer him a deal-- It's to manage a big company. Ironic right? He is treated
			as the blacksheep and here they are. Ha-Ha. Asking for his help and cooperation. Nang dahil sa hirap, pumayag si Daddy. 
			Yes. <i> Hirap. </i> A family full of debts and who only let there daughter eat in Jollibee while sila nakikita kong 
			mga gulay o di kaya Toyo o gatas kinakain. </p>

		<p> 
			After that day, we live in a nice house with a lot of toys and expensive things. Hatid sundo na ako and may kasamang
			bantay every single day kahit san man magpunta. After a month, daddy manage to make the business big and successful. 
			Sobra pa nga daw sabi ni Mommy. <i> Which makes me sad. </i> Why? Maraming nagbago. </p>

		<p> <i>
			The sweet father turns into a Monster who only cares about himself and Money. </i></p>

		<p> I am also not aware up until after my Mother's Death na she is physically abused by my Father to protect me when
			I was a little kid. Nasaskatan naman na talaga ako ng Daddy ko before but that was only because I can't go to the
			events kaya napapalo niya ako, pagkatalo ko sa Taekwondo kaya nasusuntok ako, arriving late sa firing range kaya
			minsan na niya akong natutukan at naputukan ng baril na swerteng naiwasan ko naman. Yan lang. But I didn't know that
			those times na sila lang pala ni Mommy sa sala o kwarto nila eh nilalabas na pala ni Daddy frustration niya kay Mommy. 
			Those scars and tears na nakita ko na akala ko nakuha lang ni Mommy ng dahil napuwing siya o natamaan lang ng kung anong
			matigas na sabi niya was all because of my Daddy. </p>
		
		<p>During those times, I didn't even know na may own work na rin si Mommy sa isang Company sa Tagum. Kaya lagi
			ko na lang nakikita sila Mommy at Daddy eh kada madaling araw and lagi kong kasama eh mga bantay at tagalinis
			sa bahay. </p>

		<p>But when I was Grade 3, everything turns out worst. I'm forced to move to my GrandMother in Sto. Tomas pagtongtong 
			ng March nung taon na yun. I wasn't able to attend the recognition day. I am forced to live there for good. Nakapag stay 
			naman na ako sa Grandparents ko before like 4 or 5 months long kaya wala akong kahirap hirap na mag adjust. Well except 
			sa Language. We are practicing Fokien or Mandarin nila Daddy. A slight Tagalog or Bisaya lang pag sa mga Yaya. Nakakaintindi
			naman ako ng English. Atleast kanila Lola at Lolo, sanay sila sa pagiging bulol ko and even wrong grammar. Well worst na nung nag Garde 4 ako sa mismong
			school. Mukha akong alien. But atleast, sa 1 year kong pag aadjust, nagsucceed naman. Hanggang sa umabot ng Grade 6 at
			nakagraduate. </p>

		<p> 
			By the month of May 2011, my Mother died after her 3 days of admission in San Pedro Hospital due to UTI that triggers her
			Heart to fail. I was again send back to Davao and my Father decided to enroll me at Ford Academy of he Arts. Just a few miles
			away from my home. But due to Physical Abuse (I wasn't Sexually abused by my Father. He's just into Punching, Scolding, 
			throwing, firing, and slapping) I'm again transferred back to Sto. Tomas after 1st Year High and enjoyed the rest of my stay up until I got
			my High School Diploma. </p>
			
			<p> Don't get me wrong. I also did experience some ups and downs in Life in those years and even got some of my 
				first time experiences. Only in High School, I've got to excperience playing in the mud and under the rain. 
				Plus walking while dancing from School up to the Public Market alone, dancing under the heat of the sun, 
				cooking without stove, eating noodles and canned goods that wasn't cooked, fire camping without my family 
				around, having a boyfriend without my parent's blessings, sneaking out just to go to the Circus, got depressed that
				really requires a Psychologist, got hospitalized just because of stress and even just eating isaw, etc. Weird but yeah.
				That is me. Deal with it. </p>
